<h1>Pre-Flight-Manager</h1>
<p>This tool will simplefy your preparation for your filghts. It contains 2 standard tools and
many custom from the community made tools to have everything at one place.
For Example: I build a route database which can be used offline to just save your favourite routes
or online to make it easier and more realistic to fly real routes other 
pilots created for you.<br>
This project is open-source and you're welcome to add your part or modify others.<br>

to add these features and furthermore, create your own things you believe this tool would need.<br>
